# Show Notes

We hope you didn't miss us too much while we were on vacation! Several big things have been happening, especially for Bryce.

## Bryce graduated, got married, and moved to Seattle! (00:00:53)

Bryce and Tori have been settling into their life over on the West side. Chris awkwardly says "awesome" right after hearing that their larger-than-allowed dog can't live in their apartment, because that's his default casual "let's move on" phrase, but be assured, he is quite sad at this situation.

Bryce has started work at [EMC Isilon](http://www.emc.com/domains/isilon/index.htm), on their Authentication, Identity Management, and Access team (AIMA). We use a lot of other acronyms on that conversation:

 * LDAP - [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol)
 * AD - [Active Directory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory)
 * PCAP - [Packet Capture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_analyzer)
 * SMB - [Server Message Block](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block)
 * NFS - [Network File System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System)

We were talking through [Mumble](http://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page), a great open source VoIP application.

BTW this is Cancún:
