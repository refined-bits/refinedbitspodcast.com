# Show Notes

## News (00:02:30)

### Vint Cerf: Digital Dark Age (00:02:38)

[Vint Cerf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf) worked on the [ARPANET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) and co-designed [TCP/IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) (along with [Bob Kahn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn)). He's a pretty big deal.

[Cerf's talk](http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/news-events/dls/2015/cerf-news.html) was part of the [Carnegie Mellon University Silicon Valley campus'](http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/news-events/dls/2015/cerf-news.html) [Distinguished Lecture Series](http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/news-events/dls/index.html).

*TL;DR:* In the far future, we may not be able to interpret all of the data (human history) that we're creating now, because we're storing them in formats that become obsolete and are forgotten about. Cerf [says](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31450389):

> The solution is to take an X-ray snapshot of the content and the application and the operating system together, with a description of the machine that it runs on, and preserve that for long periods of time. And that digital snapshot will recreate the past in the future.

This "snapshot" would be in a single standardized format and should ensure that the data will always be interpretable.

The [Olive Project](https://olivearchive.org/) is a current effort to preserve content in such a way.

### HTTP/2 (00:09:34)

The [IETF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) [announced](http://www.ietf.org/blog/2015/02/http2-approved/) in February that its [Internet Engineering Steering Group](http://www.ietf.org/iesg/) [has approved](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2015JanMar/0478.html) [HTTP/2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) for standardization, and it's now [in the queue for final editing and publication](http://www.rfc-editor.org/queue2.html#draft-ietf-httpbis-http2)!

There are [a few implementations](https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations) out there, with hopefully many more to come in the next year or so. [NGINX has committed](http://nginx.com/blog/how-nginx-plans-to-support-http2/) to having a release with HTTP/2 support "by the end of 2015". Apache has a ticket to track support, but there haven't been any announcements that work has started on it yet.

And don't worry, IIS [isn't going away](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2014/02/18/introducing-asp-net-project-helios.aspx) with the new [ASP.NET vNext](http://www.asp.net/vnext). The thing was that it will no longer be *coupled* to IIS, and will be [server-agnostic](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Servers).

### Raspberry Pi 2 (00:14:25)

The [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) came out in February, replacing the [Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/) at the top of the product line.

The move to the [Cortex-A7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-A7) means that the Pi now joins the [myriad consumer devices](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1596800) on the market using the ARMv7 architecture. Operating systems previously out of reach, like [Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM) and [Windows](http://dev.windows.com/en-us/featured/raspberrypi2support), can now run unhindered on the platform.

The NUC ([Next Unit of Computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Unit_of_Computing)) is an Intel-designed small form factor PC platform. Its priorities are energy efficiency and having a tiny footprint. And although it shares several [potential applications](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/usage-examples.html) with the Pi, it's designed for desktop-level performance and versatility.

## Starting Out in the Industry with Eric Ball (00:24:13)

### What Eric Does (00:24:36)

Eric is a "Software Engineer in Performance and Tools" for [ExtraHop](http://www.extrahop.com/)!

### The Interview Process (00:38:23)

 * Getting to know you from your past work.
   * GitHub comes in handy!
 * Solving problems on the whiteboard.
   * Some not necessarily solvable.
   * It's about how you solve problems.

### Advice for New Developers (00:43:03)

 * Set yourself apart!
   * Everyone around you also did the same computer science course projects.
   * What have you done outside of coursework?
 * Be passionate about the work.
 * You don't have to have a job where you write code all day -- explore!
 * Have questions for the other side of the table.
   * [Here's a list of ideas!](https://github.com/ChiperSoft/InterviewThis/blob/master/InterviewThis.md)
   * [The Joel Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html)
 * **It's important to be able to admit when you don't know something.**

## Controversy Corner: "Ninjas" and "Rockstars" (01:09:46)

 * We don't need our job descriptions to be spiced up -- we're already excited about programming!
 * It isn't very descriptive; it's just fluff.
 * It sounds like you don't know what you want.
   * Maybe it's being written by non-developers and they're trying to make it sound more fun because they don't know how fun programming is to us.
   * But maybe those non-developers writing programmer job descriptions *should* know more.
 * Maybe those terms are used to try to convey the level of respect and adoration that the company has for developers.
   * But a culture that puts one kind of employee on a pedestal breeds its own problems.
   * Do you want non-developers feeling second-class?
   * Do you want developers who think that they're better than everyone else?
     * These kinds of developers tend to find it hard to admit when they don't know something.
     * They might even put themselves above other developers, undermining the trust and cohesion of the team.
   * The terms are meaningless -- *show* appreciation with real things, like paid time off, food, and recreation.
