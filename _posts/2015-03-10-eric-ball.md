### Vint Cerf: Digital Dark Age (00:02:38)

[Vint Cerf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf) worked on the [ARPANET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) and co-designed [TCP/IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) (along with [Bob Kahn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn)). He's a pretty big deal.

[Cerf's talk](http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/news-events/dls/2015/cerf-news.html) was part of the [Carnegie Mellon University Silicon Valley campus'](http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/news-events/dls/2015/cerf-news.html) [Distinguished Lecture Series](http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/news-events/dls/index.html).

*TL;DR:* In the far future, we may not be able to interpret all of the data (human history) that we're creating now, because we're storing them in formats that become obsolete and are forgotten about. Cerf [says](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31450389):

> The solution is to take an X-ray snapshot of the content and the application and the operating system together, with a description of the machine that it runs on, and preserve that for long periods of time. And that digital snapshot will recreate the past in the future.

This "snapshot" would be in a single standardized format and should ensure that the data will always be interpretable.

The [Olive Project](https://olivearchive.org/) is a current effort to preserve content in such a way.
